Got it 👍 — that error is a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) problem. It’s not about your HTML being wrong, it’s about the browser refusing to load the CSV because the request looks “unsafe” when run from a local file. Let me break it down:

🔹 Why this happens

When you open your HTML directly from Finder (so the URL is like file:///.../index.html), the browser treats your origin as null.

Then, when you try to fetch data from Google Sheets (https://docs.google.com/...), Chrome blocks it because Google’s server doesn’t send the required Access-Control-Allow-Origin header.

This is standard browser security — it prevents random local files from requesting data from the internet.

🔹 Ways to Fix It
Option 1: Run a local web server (recommended)

Instead of opening index.html directly, serve it.
On Mac you can run a simple server:

If you have Python 3:

cd /path/to/your/project
python3 -m http.server 8000


Then open: http://localhost:8000/index.html

If you have Node.js:

npx http-server .


Now your page will load from http://localhost:8000 (not file://), and CORS errors usually go away.


python3 -m http.server 8000

http://localhost:8000/
